# Linear-mtGenome-In-Sponges

The mtDNA in one demosponge is found to be linear and has two distinct features - an ORF similar to DNA Polymerases and a group 2 intron in cox2 encoding an RT-like protein. 

We aim to predict or hypothesize the organism or molecule from where these modifications have been brought in the mtDNA in the evolutionary pathway. And to observe whether these sequences are functional or not. The bigger question is the transition between typical circular and atypical linear mt-genome architecture in animals.
Two questions that we aim to address:
1)Where did DNA polymerase and intron protein come from and is it functional?
2)To check the conservation of functionally-important residues in  DNA polymerases and intronic proteins to predict whether they may function in sponges or not.
